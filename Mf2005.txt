NAME
     modflow - Modular three-dimensional finite-difference ground-water
               model

ABSTRACT
     MODFLOW is a three-dimensional finite-difference ground-water model
     that was first published in 1984.  It has a modular structure that
     allows it to be easily modified to adapt the code for a particular
     application.  Many new capabilities have been added to the original
     model.  Harbaugh (2005) documents a general update to MODFLOW, which
     is called MODFLOW-2005 in order to distinguish it from earlier
     versions.

     MODFLOW-2005 simulates steady and nonsteady flow in an irregularly
     shaped flow system in which aquifer layers can be confined,
     unconfined, or a combination of confined and unconfined.  Flow from
     external stresses, such as flow to wells, areal recharge,
     evapotranspiration, flow to drains, and flow through river beds,
     can be simulated.  Hydraulic conductivities or transmissivities for
     any layer may differ spatially and be anisotropic (restricted to
     having the principal directions aligned with the grid axes), and the
     storage coefficient may be heterogeneous.  Specified head and
     specified flux boundaries can be simulated as can a head dependent
     flux across the model's outer boundary that allows water to be
     supplied to a boundary block in the modeled area at a rate
     proportional to the current head difference between a "source" of
     water outside the modeled area and the boundary block.

     In addition to simulating ground-water flow, the scope of
     MODFLOW-2005 has been expanded to incorporate related capabilities
     such as solute transport and ground-water management; however, this
     distribution incorporates only the ground-water flow parts of MODFLOW.


METHOD
     The ground-water flow equation is solved using the finite-difference
     approximation.  The flow region is subdivided into blocks in which
     the medium properties are assumed to be uniform.  In plan view the
     blocks are made from a grid of mutually perpendicular lines that may
     be variably spaced.  Model layers can have varying thickness.  A flow
     equation is written for each block, called a cell.  Several solvers
     are provided for solving the resulting matrix problem; the user can
     choose the best solver for the particular problem.  Flow-rate and
     cumulative-volume balances from each type of inflow and outflow are
     computed for each time step.
